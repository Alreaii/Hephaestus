# Hephaestus
*Tool written for the 2021 NASA SpaceApps 48 hour Hackathon on the challenge "Warning! Things are heating up!*

## Pitch
Hephaestus is a mobile application that provides warnings about potential health, environmental and agricultural hazards by scraping data from satellites from various space agencies across the world. The potential hazards are determined by the pollution, temperature, humidity, and UV exposure. We used a combination of mathematical algorithms which takes all these factors into account to create a weighted index which we've named the Potential Danger Index, or PoDIn for short.

All this allows the app to create an accurate prediction of the potential danger in any given area which we have corresponding data for. Along with PoDIn, the app will provide advice and mitigation measures to help people from many of the hazards related to pollution, heat and so forth.
